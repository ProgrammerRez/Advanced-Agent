       "(['Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born  German politician who was the dictator of Germany during the Nazi era, which lasted from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor of Germany in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934. Hitler\\'s ideology was rooted in white nationalist principles promoting the \"Aryan\" (Germanic) race as biologically superior to other ethnic groups. He persued conquering Europe to ensure the dominance of this \"master race\" over supposedly inferior groups. His invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 marked the outbreak of the Second World War. Throughout the ensuing conflict, Hitler was closely involved in the direction of German military operations as well as the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.\\nHitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and moved to Germany in 1913. He wa',\n",
       "  'The Hitler family consists of the relatives and ancestors of Adolf Hitler. The family has long been of interest to historians and genealogists because of the biological uncertainty of Hitler\\'s paternal grandfather, as well as the family\\'s inter-relationships and their psychological effect on Hitler during his childhood and later life.\\nAlois Schicklgruber (Adolf\\'s father) changed his surname on 7 January 1877 to \"Hitler\" (derived from that of his deceased stepfather, Johann Georg Hiedler), which was the only form of the last name that his son Adolf used. Before Adolf Hitler\\'s birth, his family used many variations of the family surname \"Hitler\" almost interchangeably. Some of the common variants were Hiedler, Hüttler, Hytler, and Hittler.\\nAdolf Hitler\\'s sister Paula, who died in 1960 and did not have children, was the last member of the family still bearing the Hitler surname on their tombstone. As of 2023, only five members of the Hitler family bloodline, all men who bore no children, ',\n",
       "  'Nazi Germany, officially the German Reich and later the Greater German Reich, was the German state between 1933 and 1945, when Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party controlled the country, transforming it into a totalitarian dictatorship. The Third Reich, meaning \"Third Realm\" or \"Third Empire\", referred to the Nazi claim that Nazi Germany was the successor to the Holy Roman Empire (800–1806) and the German Empire (1871–1918). The Third Reich, which the Nazis referred to as the Thousand-Year Reich, ended in May 1945, after 12 years, when the Allies defeated Germany and entered the capital, Berlin, ending World War II in Europe.\\nAfter Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany in 1933, the Nazi Party began to eliminate political opposition and consolidate power. A 1934 German referendum confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (leader). Power was centralised in Hitler\\'s person, and his word became the highest law.

       "(['While originally designed for natural language processing tasks, the self-attention mechanism has recently taken various computer vision areas by storm. However, the 2D nature of images brings three challenges for applying self-attention in computer vision. (1) Treating images as 1D sequences neglects their 2D structures. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images. (3) It only captures spatial adaptability but ignores channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel linear attention named large kernel attention (LKA) to enable self-adaptive and long-range correlations in self-attention while avoiding its shortcomings. Furthermore, we present a neural network based on LKA, namely Visual Attention Network (VAN). While extremely simple, VAN surpasses similar size vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in various tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, pose estimat',\n",
       "  \"Driven by the scalable diffusion models trained on large-scale datasets, text-to-image synthesis methods have shown compelling results. However, these models still fail to precisely follow the text prompt involving multiple objects, attributes, or spatial compositions. In this paper, we reveal the potential causes in the diffusion model's cross-attention and self-attention layers. We propose two novel losses to refocus attention maps according to a given spatial layout during sampling. Creating the layouts manually requires additional effort and can be tedious. Therefore, we explore using large language models (LLM) to produce these layouts for our method. We conduct extensive experiments on the DrawBench, HRS, and TIFA benchmarks to evaluate our proposed method. We show that our proposed attention refocusing effectively improves the controllability of existing approaches.\",\n",
       "  'Attention mechanisms, especially self-attention, have played an increasingly important role in deep feature representation for visual tasks. Self-attention updates the feature at each position by computing a weighted sum of features using pair-wise affinities across all positions to capture the long-range dependency within a single sample. However, self-attention has quadratic complexity and ignores potential correlation between different samples. This paper proposes a novel attention mechanism which we call external attention, based on two external, small, learnable, shared memories, which can be implemented easily by simply using two cascaded linear layers and two normalization layers; it conveniently replaces self-attention in existing popular architectures. External attention has linear complexity and implicitly considers the correlations between all data samples. We further incorporate the multi-head mechanism into external attention to provide an all-MLP architecture, external at'],\n",
